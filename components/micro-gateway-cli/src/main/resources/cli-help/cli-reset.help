NAME
     micro-gw help reset - resets the user related configurations.

SYNOPSIS
     micro-gw reset [-c|--config]

DESCRIPTION
    
     The reset command is used to clear all the previous user configurations, such as "--username",
     "--clientId", etc. This will enable different user credentials to be provided when importing APIs from
     WSO2 API Manager
     
     When running the setup command for the first time, those configurations are stored internally within the
     microgateway CLI tool and will be reused for subsequent import commands. To rerun the import command with a
     different user credentials, the reset command needs to be run beforehand.
     
     Using "micro-gw reset -c <config-file>", we can reset an externally provided config file. 

EXAMPLES
    Reset user related configuration to default.
    $ micro-gw reset
    
    Reset an external config file
    $ micro-gw reset -c /home/user/micro-gw/external-config.toml
